### Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It's essential for running JavaScript outside the browser and for managing packages via **npm** (Node Package Manager).

1. **Go to the official Node.js website**:  
   [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Download and install Node.js**:  
   You'll see two versions: 
   - **LTS** (Long Term Support): Recommended for most users.
   - **Current**: Latest features, but may be less stable.

   Choose **LTS** unless you need the latest features.

3. **Verify the installation**:  
   Once installed, open your terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal on Mac) and type the following commands to check if Node.js and npm were installed correctly:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
